    <h1> Residue </h1>
</div>

A super minimal responsive classless CSS framework, coming in at just under 1kB minified currently (with refinements to come later).

Residue is still in development and not yet ready for production use.

You can see it in action [here](https://icosahunter.github.io/residue/).
