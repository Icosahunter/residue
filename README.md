## Use Case

Residue is meant to be the bare minimum that actually looks like a proper website.
It's not the prettiest thing out there but it *works* and it's tiny.
It's main use cases are as a default styling that is minimal and aesthetically neutral (my main use case for creating it), or as a building block for something prettier and more useful.
